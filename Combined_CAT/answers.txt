PART ONE
Question 1
a. Public Inheritance - When deriving from a public class the derived class inherits the public members and also protected member from the base class but protected members of the base class are never inherited
b. Protected inheritance - When deriving from a protected class the protected and public members of the base class become protected members of the derived class
c. Private inheritance - When deriving from a private class the public and protected members of the base class become private members of teh derived class


Question 2
A while loop will check the condition first before executing the content while a do while loop executes the content of the loop before it checks the condition of the while
A while loop never executes if condition is false while a do-while loop executes at least once even if the condition is false

Question 3
a i = 9
b ii = 10

Question 5
variable declaration is for informing to the compiler the following information: name of the variable, type of value it holds and initial value if any it takes. No space is reserved in memory. What compiler needs to accept reference to the variable
extern int a;
definition says where the variable gets stored in memory. Addition of declarations but space reservation is done. It is what the linker needs to link references to that variable
int a;


PART TWO
Question 1
call by value
actual copy of arguments are passed to formal arguments and changes made aren't reflected in the actual arguments
actual arguments remain preserved and there is no chance of modification
call by reference
location of actual arguments are passed to formal arguments and any changes made are reflected in the actual arguments
actual arguments will not be preserved


Question 3
a constructor is a special member function of a class that is executed new objects of that class are created
It has the same name as the class and doesn't have a return type


Question 4
